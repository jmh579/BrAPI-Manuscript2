### Genotyping

<!-- Ajay -->
Genotyping has become a cornerstone of most breeding processes, but managing the data can be challenging. Understanding different genotyping protocols for various crops is crucial due to the unique genetic structures of each species. Techniques such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS), SSRs, Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), and array-based genotyping each offer specific advantages depending on the crop and research objectives. BrAPI supports genotypic data by utilizing existing standards such as the variant call format (VCF) [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btr330] and the GA4GH Variants schema [@https://github.com/ga4gh-metadata/SchemaBlocks]. The BrAPI community has developed compatible tools for storing, searching, visualizing, and analyzing genotypic data, making it easier to integrate and utilize this information in breeding programs. Mastery of the various genotyping protocols ensures efficient and effective breeding, while BrAPI-compliant tools streamline data management and analysis, enhancing the ability to make data-driven decisions in developing superior crop varieties.
