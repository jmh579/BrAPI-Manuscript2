[GridScore](https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/get-gridscore/) [@doi:10.1186/s12859-022-04755-2] is a web-based application for recording phenotypic observations that harnesses mobile devices to enrich the data collection process. 
The GridScore interface closely mirrors the look and feel of printed field plans, creating an intuitive user experience. 
GridScore performs a wide range of functions, including data validation, data visualization, georeferencing, multi-platform support, and data synchronization across multiple devices. 
The application's data collection approach employs a top-down view onto the trial and offers field navigation mechanisms using barcodes, QR codes, or guided walks that take the data collector through the field in one of 16 pre-defined orders.

BrAPI has further increased the value of GridScore by integrating it into the overarching plant breeding workflow. 
Trial designs and trait definitions can be imported into GridScore using BrAPI and a finalized trial can be exported via BrAPI to any compatible database.
