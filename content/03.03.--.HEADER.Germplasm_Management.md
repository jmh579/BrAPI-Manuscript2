### Germplasm Management

<!-- Ajay -->
Germplasm data management is crucial due to the vast quantity of new accessions, variants, and lines created yearly. Germplasm is the basis of variation on which breeders rely to upgrade and optimize their breeding programs. This is essential at any scale including individual breeding programs, national initiatives, and international collaborations. BrAPI supports the transmission of germplasm passport data, pedigree trees, and crossing metadata. The BrAPI community has developed compliant tools for storing, searching, and visualizing this metadata, facilitating efficient management. Additionally, there are plans to establish federated networks of genebank data connected via BrAPI, enhancing global accessibility and collaboration in germplasm management.
