#### DArTView

<!-- Moses N -->
[DArTView](https://software.kddart.com/kdxplore/dartview/dartviewdocs/KDXplore-DartView.html) is a desktop application for marker data curation via metadata filtering. DArTView enables genotype variant data visualization designed such that users can easily identify trends or correlations within their data. The primary goal of the tool is to overcome tedious manual calculation of marker data through common spreadsheet applications like Excel. Users are able to import marker data from csv files, but DArTView has been recently enhanced to be BrAPI compatible. BrAPI provides a consistent data standard across databases and data resources, which allows DArTView to use any BrAPI-compatible server as an input data source. DArTView's compatibility with BrAPI also ensures easy integration with other tools and pipelines that would use DArTView for marker filtering and exploration.

Initially developed by DArT, the tool is gaining popularity within the breeding community, especially in Africa. Future releases will focus on enhancing the BrAPI compatibility, making it accessible to more breeders and researchers. A web enabled version of DArTView is in development. This new version will allow for further collaboration opportunities with other interested partners who would like to integrate it as part of their pipelines.
