#### MGIS

The [Musa Germplasm Information System (MGIS)](https://www.crop-diversity.org/mgis/) serves as a comprehensive community portal dedicated to banana diversity, a crop critical to global food security [@doi:10.1093/database/bax046]. MGIS offers detailed information on banana germplasm, focusing on the collections held by the CGIAR International Banana Genebank (ITC) [@doi:10.1186/s43170-020-00015-6]. It is built on the Drupal/Tripal technology, like BIMS [@doi:10.1093/database/baab054] and Floril√®ge. 

Since its inception, MGIS developers have actively participated in the BrAPI community. The MGIS team pushed for the integration of the Multi-Crop Passport Data (MCPD) standard into the Germplasm module of the API. MCPD support was added in BrAPI v1.3, and MGIS now provides passport data information on ITC banana genebank accessions (with GLIS DOI), synchronized with [Genesys](https://www.genesys-pgr.org/a/overview/v2YdWZGrZjD). MGIS also enriches the passport data by incorporating additional information from other germplasm collections worldwide. All the germplasm data is available through the BrAPI-Germplasm module implementation. For genotyping data, MGIS integrates with Gigwa [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giz051], which provides a tailored implementation of the BrAPI genotyping module. Furthermore, MGIS supports a set of BrAPI-Phenotyping module endpoints, facilitating the exposure of morphological descriptors and trait information supported by ontologies like the Crop Ontology [@doi:10.1093/aobpla/plq008]. MGIS has integrated the Trait Selector BrAPP, and there are use cases implemented to interlink genebank and breeding data between MGIS and the breeding database MusaBase.
