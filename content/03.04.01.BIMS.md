#### BIMS

<!-- Sook -->
The [Breeding Information Management System (BIMS)](https://wwww.breedwithbims.org) [@doi:10.1093/database/baab054] is a free, secure, online breeding management system which allows breeders to store, manage, archive, and analyze their private breeding program data. 
BIMS enables individual breeders to have complete control of their own breeding data along with access to tools such as data import, export, analysis, and archiving for their germplasm, phenotype, genotype, and image data. 
BIMS is currently implemented in five community databases, the Genome Database for Rosaceae [@doi:10.1093/nar/gky1000], CottonGEN [@doi:10.3390/plants10122805], the Citrus Genome Database, the Pulse Crop Database, and the Genome Database for Vaccinium, where it enables individual breeders to import publicly available data. 
BIMS is also implemented in the public database [breedwithbims.org](https://wwww.breedwithbims.org) that any breeder can use.

BIMS primarily utilizes BrAPI to connect with Field Book [@doi:10.2135/cropsci2013.08.0579], enabling seamless data transfer between data collection and subsequent management in BIMS. Data transfer through BrAPI between BIMS and other resources such as Breedbase [@doi:10.1093/g3journal/jkac078], GIGWA [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giz051], and the Breeder Genomics Hub [@https://hub.maizegenetics.net/] is under development.
