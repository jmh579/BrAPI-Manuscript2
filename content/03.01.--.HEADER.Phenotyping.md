### Phenotyping

<!-- Ajay and Trevor -->
Phenotyping is fundamental to plant breeding and genetics research, providing the accurate, high-quality data needed for downstream analyses and selection decisions.
Effective phenotyping requires a thorough understanding of both biological research questions and operational data gathering techniques to ensure successful outcomes.
Collected data, subsequent analyses, and data visualizations all impact and shape downstream experiments.
The BrAPI specification supports phenotypic data throughout the entire breeding pipeline, including collection, analyses, publication, and archiving.
The BrAPI community has developed several BrAPI-compatible tools to facilitate data standardization, efficient storage, and curation of phenotypic data and trait metadata.
Ongoing development efforts are creating tools to manage images and other high-throughput phenotypic data sources, further enhancing the precision and efficiency of plant breeding research.
By supporting the collection and storage of phenotypic data accurately and efficiently, BrAPI compatible tools (as outlined below) simplify the conversion of phenotypes into actionable insights that are necessary to help digitize and boost modern breeding and genetics research programs.
The following set of BrAPI-compatible tools were developed to support some aspect of the phenotyping process.
