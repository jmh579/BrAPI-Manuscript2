#### Helium

<!-- Paul S -->
[Helium](https://helium.hutton.ac.uk) [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-15-259] is a pedigree visualization platform designed to account for the unique characteristics of plant pedigrees. 
A pedigree is a representation of the relationships between discrete individuals, linking individual plants or lines with their parents and progeny. 
Plant pedigrees inform crossing decisions, are required for variety releases, and are often used to check for potential genotyping or phenotyping errors [@doi:10.1111/j.1365-2052.2011.02183.x].
The accurate representation of pedigrees and ability to pull pedigree data from different data sources is critical to plant breeding and genetics. 
BrAPI enables Helium users to do just this, facilitating data import from other BrAPI compliant databases for visualization.

While originally designed for plants [@doi:10.3389/fpls.2024.1268847] it has also found utility in other non-plant projects [@doi:10.1007/s10592-024-01611-z]. 
Helium is used in projects ranging in size from tens to tens of thousands of lines and across a wide variety of crops and species.
