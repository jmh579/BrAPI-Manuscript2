## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Population growth and climate change necessitate extraordinary efforts to increase efficiency in breeding programs around the world. 
Recent advancements in phenotyping techniques, genotyping technologies, and prediction approaches are facilitating increased genetic gain in breeding, but they have also created a torrent of disconnected data. 
The successful implementation of these methods depends on proper data management, which is particularly challenging due to the need to integrate datasets across various types, formats, and sources. 
The Breeding API (BrAPI) project is an international effort that is enabling more efficient data management through the development of interoperable research databases and tools that can be used to share and interpret breeding-related data. 
This community driven standard is software agnostic, open-source, and can be used by anyone interested in plant breeding, phenotyping, germplasm, genotyping, and agronomy data management. 
This manuscript presents an overview of the BrAPI project, the substantial growth of the data standard, and the wide variety of BrAPI-compatible, community-built tools for breeding and research.
