#### Field Book

<!-- Trevor and Chaney -->

Data from plant breeding and genetics experiments has traditionally been collected using pen and paper, but this approach often results in transcription errors and delayed analysis.
[Field Book](fieldbook.phenoapps.org/) [@doi:10.2135/cropsci2013.08.0579], a highly-customizable Android app, was developed to help scientists digitize and organize their phenotypic data as measurements and images are collected.
This effectively improves data collection speed, reduces errors, and enables larger and more robust breeding populations and data sets. 

Field Book has added support for BrAPI to streamline data transfer to and from BrAPI-compatible servers.
This improvement has removed the need to manually transfer data files, simplifies data exchange between these systems, and reduces the opportunities for human error and data loss.
