#### G-Crunch

<!-- Josh -->
[G-Crunch](https://github.com/CornellILCI/G-CrunchUI) is an upcoming user-facing tool to make simple, repeatable analysis requests. The lightweight UI can be used to specify and filter incoming data, select specific analysis criteria, and trigger any analytics pipeline that is built into the specific framework instance. G-Crunch is currently built on top of the open source [Analytics Framework](https://github.com/CornellILCI/af-pipeline) project, and can run pipelines using tools such as sommer and ASREML. Each piece fo the data and pipeline can be separately specified, which can allow flexibility when running complex analysis. A 'test' analysis can be run on small data sets with small or local analytics engine, then quickly re-direct G-Crunch to a larger dataset and a larger computational framework. This mitigates the complications of moving data around and introducing errors from manually triggering the analysis steps.

G-Crunch relies on BrAPI endpoints to access phenotypic and genotypic data sources, as well as an API currently implemented in the Analytics Framework to start and track processes. G-Crunch, as a tool, couldn't feasibly exist without BrAPI. The support of BrAPI interfaces allows G-Crunch to use one unified request method, and adapt to the user's existing network of BrAPI-compliant tools. This lowers the barrier to entry for adoption, and makes analysis pipelines easily repeatable.
