## Manuscript description

This is an updated manuscript for the BrAPI Project and Community. The [first BrAPI paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz190/5418796)
was focused on the technical aspects of BrAPI and its potential. This manuscript gives us an opportunity to report on the project success so far and show how that potential has become a reality.
